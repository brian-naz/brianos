# BrianOS

A compiliation of all the "mobile" apps I've built elsewhere on GitHub. Just a fun project idea that I had :)

### Changelog:

(Feb 20 2026)

v0.1.0:

- Initial Release
- Added Weather and Messaging App shortcuts


### Bugs:

- Current Location services do not work
- Battery charging does not display
- Wifi / network signal does not work on Safari. There may not be a fix for this, ever
- The swipe up to close app may not work as intended on Desktop. So use the Esc key for now
